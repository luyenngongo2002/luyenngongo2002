        <p>My first day pf the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>cellphone</li>
                <li>iPod</li>
                <li>cigital camera</li>
                <li>aprotein ber</li>               
            </ol>
        <p>Just the essential. As LaoTzu would have would have said,
             "A joutney of a thousand miles begins with one Segnway</p>
